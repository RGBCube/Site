---

## Hi.

I'm yet another high schooler that is interested in programming.
I'm from Türkiye 🇹🇷.

I primarily use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and
also know quite a bit of Python, Java, Kotlin, Go,
JavaScript (No frameworks, though!), [**Nix**](https://nixos.org/)
and [Nushell](https://nushell.sh/).

I've created this blog using Rust, [Axum](https://lib.rs/crates/axum),
[Maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz/) and a bunch of other neat crates.
The webserver itself is hosted on a small VPS running [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
and is proxied behing Cloudflare.
