So, you may have seen the [HTMNIX](https://github.com/RGBCube/HTMNIX) project I've
been working on the last few weeks. If not, no worries. Here is a Nix snippet
that uses it:

```nix
<html>
  <head>
    <title>"Hello, Internet!"<.title>
  <.head>
  <body>
      <p>"Yep, this is 100% Nix!"<.p>

      <img.>{src="/foo.png"; alt="Attributes also work!";}
  <.body>
<.html>
```

You are probably thinking furiously right now, maybe you've noticed something:

> Aha! In Nix, `<foo>` is used to find stuff from the Nix path like so:

You are somewhat correct. But not quite.

Nix `<foo>` expressions actually boil down to a call of the builtin `__findFile`, like so:

```shell
❯ nix-instantiate --parse --expr "<foo>"

(__findFile __nixPath "foo")
```

Aha! So this means we can override the builtin `__findFile` and put whatever we would like in
its place. So this will work:

```nix
let
  __findFile = nixPath: name: {
    content = "<${name}>";
  };
in
<foo>
```

Evaluating this (by running `nix eval -f test.nix`), we get `{ content = "<foo>"; }`

So, then. How do we make it work for multiple tags, all coming after one another
(and attribute sets, strings, etc.)?

Another hack! We need to set the [magic `__functor` attribute](https://noogle.dev/md/tutorials/functors)
of the attrset we return, so we can call our set and have it store the tags inside it (while also
preserving its callability!).

We can do that like so:

```nix
let
  __findFile = nixPath: name: {
    content = "<${name}>";
    __functor = self: next: self // {
      content = self.content + next;
    };
  };
in
<foo>
"bar"
"baz"
```

Great news! When we evaluate this, we get `{ __functor = <LAMBDA>; content = "<foo>barbaz"; }`.

We can also add a case to check if the next element is a tag, and use its content if it is:

```nix
let
  __findFile = nixPath: name: {
    content = "<${name}>";
    __functor = self: next: self // {
      content = self.content + (if next ? content then next.content else next);
    };
  };
in
<foo>
"bar"
"baz"
<endfoo>
```

Enter another hack! We can utilize the `outPath` property that exists on derivations
and gets returned whenever you call `toString` with an attrset that has the property to make our code a little simpler:

```nix
let
  __findFile = nixPath: name: {
    outPath = "<${name}>";
    __functor = self: next: self // {
      outPath = self.outPath + toString next;
    };
  };
in
<foo>
"bar"
"baz"
123
<endfoo>
```

We also got support for other types for free, as well!

These are all the hidden builtins that [HTMNIX](https://github.com/RGBCube/HTMNIX) depends on
and extends upon, making HTML in Nix an actually usable reality. It also
has extra logic like turning attribute sets into HTML tags, which is fairly trivial
compared to actaully discovering these hidden builtins in the first place.

You can read more about it in the project's README and
see [an example site using it](https://github.com/RGBCube/NixSite).

I might even try to port this site to HTMNIX to ensure it is usable with more complex setups :-)

Soon, maybe...
