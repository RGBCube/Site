You just started a new project. You ran `cargo init`,
`poetry init` and `go mod init`.

Those commands created the necessary files to work, it
also added the following lines to your .gitignore:

```
target
__pycache__
bin
```

All great. You continue implementing features, and when
the time comes, you publish your project to your Git
hosting platform of choice.

People start to get interested in your project. One even
decides that he's going to implement a new feature!
Literally free work done for you!

Alright. That person uses his code editor and tools bundled
with his operating system to implement a very cool
new feature. He then submits the merge request.

You start reviewing the code and notice a file quite
out of place: `.DS_Store`. You ask the person what
it is, he says he has no clue.

![Hundreds of thousands of merge requests on GitHub trying
to gitignore .DS_Store](/assets/github-ds-store-mr-list.webp)

Whatever. You just delete the file from the branch and
add the file's name to the repositories gitignore:

```
target
__pycache__
bin
.DS_Store
```


Nice. Now the code is on master, and your repository
only contains relevant information.

Then, someone using an IDE created using web technologies
submits another merge request. You look at it, and
see that there is a whole directory that is irrelevant.
You tell that person to delete the directory from the
branch and add it to the gitignore. The gitignore lives on:

```
target
__pycache__
bin
.DS_Store
.vscode
```

Then, someone that uses IntelliJ IDEA commits five hundred
XML files and the `.idea` directory. You repeat this process:

```
target
__pycache__
bin
.DS_Store
.vscode
.idea
```

Years pass. Now your gitignore is hundreds of lines long,
yet people keep accidentally committing in test scripts,
foo, a, qux, data.tar.gz, start.sh, bin-release,
cat, asd, fgsgskfh.

Hell. You feel like a mythic god undergoing punishment
for cheating death and deceiving the underworld.

on it](/assets/sisyphus-ds-store.webp)

How do you escape this endless loop of ignoring files
that sneak in? Maybe by educating every single merge
request author? Nope, that definitely won't work, there
should be a way to automatically handle this with tooling,
rather than subjective human communication.

Luckily, you realize that you can turn the blacklist
of files (the gitignore) to a whitelist, by just
ignoring everything and manually un-ignoring desired
files. You change your gitignore to this:

```
*

!.gitignore

!src/*.rs
!Cargo.{toml,lock}

!pysrc/*.py
!pyproject.toml
!poetry.lock

!cmd/*.go
!main.go
!go.{mod,sum}

!docs/*.md
```

Now, nobody can accidentally commit undesired files,
as git automatically ignores them all and only
allows the files that are explicitly whitelisted.
It's also future proof, future proof until an IDE
decides to use the `src/ide.rs` file as a convenient
way of storing project specific configuration.
And hopefully that future never comes.

You feel relieved.
