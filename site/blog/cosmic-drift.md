So, every day I wake up at 6:55, get dressed by 7, walk to the bus stop
by 7:13 and board the bus around 7:17. Today was different.

My alarm that I have set for 6:55 rang at 7:12 and as a result, I missed the bus.

Surely something was happening. Machines don't break whenever they want, they're
mostly deterministic. And I doubt Samsung engineers wrote code to delay the alarm
by 12 minutes on the date after April 1st.

So, _what_ was happening? I entered the Python repl to test out a theory:

```py
>>> alarm_time = 6*60*60 + 55*60
>>> alarm_time_real = 7*60*60 + 12*60
>>> alarm_time_real - alarm_time
1020
```

The total time was off by about 1020 seconds. Give or take 60, as my phone
doesn't display the seconds of the time.

Wow, I thought. That's really close to 1024 (which is 2 to the power of 10).
Maybe the 11th bit got flipped, making it increment 1024?

```py
>>> bin(alarm_time)
'0b110000101000100'
>>> alarm_time |= 1 << 10
>>> bin(alarm_time)
'0b110010101000100'
>>> alarm_time - alarm_time_real
-4
```

Aha! So the 11th bit got flipped by something. And that something was probably
a cosmic ray.

EDIT: It was not a cosmic ray. As pointed out by [@BenjaminRi's comment on lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/jb1o6q/cosmic_drift#c_1ztluj)
it was either a bug or storage corruption as the alarm ran late the next day. You should
still create more than one alarm just in case if you are using a phone prone to this, however.

My main takeaway from this event is to create more than one alarm, for extra redundancy.
Who knew being prone to sleeping in could save you from your alarm getting
shifted 12 minutes into the future :^).
