## Hi.

I'm yet another high schooler that is interested in programming.
I'm from TÃ¼rkiye ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·.

I primarily use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and
also know quite a bit of Python, [**Nix**](https://nixos.org/),
[Nushell](https://nushell.sh/), a little bit of Java, Kotlin, Go,
and JavaScript (No frameworks, though!).

I created this site using [Lume](https://lume.land/). It is served
by Nginx on my small VPS that runs [NixOS](https://nixos.org/).

I also host other services like Synapse (Matrix homeserver), Forgejo,
Nextcloud and Grafana on the VPS, which are all configured using Nix.

Historically, this blog was made using Rust, [Axum](https://lib.rs/crates/axum),
[Maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz/) and a bunch of other neat crates (some which
I created, like [embd-rs](https://github.com/RGBCube/embd-rs), which sped up
development). But I decided to abandon this strategy as I was reinventing too much
for just a simple static website. Development was also *really* slow on a i5 from
2015 so I decided to ditch it and use Lume.

Here is the up to date [GitHub repository for said site](https://github.com/RGBCube/Site),
and here is the [historical version written in Rust](https://github.com/RGBCube/Site/tree/rust-legacy).
